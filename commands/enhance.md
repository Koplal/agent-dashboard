Enhance the following request into an optimized prompt, then execute it.

## Step 1: Analyze

Original request: $ARGUMENTS

Identify what's missing:
- [ ] Language/framework specified?
- [ ] Scope defined (what's included/excluded)?
- [ ] Output format specified?
- [ ] Audience identified?
- [ ] Constraints listed?
- [ ] Success criteria defined?

## Step 2: Clarify (if needed)

If critical information is missing, ask 1-5 targeted questions:

"To ensure the best result, I need to clarify:

1. [Question about missing element]
2. [Question]
..."

Wait for answers before proceeding.

## Step 3: Build Enhanced Prompt

Create an optimized prompt structure:

```
### Task
[Clear description with imperative verbs]
[Explicit depth: "Go beyond basics..." if appropriate]

### Requirements
[From answers + inferred from context]

### Constraints
- Format: [Specific format]
- Technical: [Language, framework, etc.]
- Scope: [Boundaries]

### Output Format
[Exact structure expected]

### Success Criteria
- [What makes it complete]
- [What makes it excellent]
```

## Step 4: Confirm

Show the enhanced prompt:

"Here's the enhanced prompt:

[Show prompt]

Ready to execute? (yes/adjust)"

## Step 5: Execute

When confirmed, execute the enhanced prompt directly—do the actual work, don't just describe what you would do.

Deliver the output with a brief summary of what was created.
