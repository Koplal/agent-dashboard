You are starting a new project. Follow this exact workflow:

## Step 1: Analyze the Request

Request: $ARGUMENTS

Determine if this needs clarification:
- Is the scope clear?
- Are technical requirements specified?
- Is the expected output defined?

## Step 2: Gather Requirements (if needed)

If anything is unclear, ask 1-5 clarifying questions NOW. Format as:

"Before I plan this project, I need to clarify a few things:

1. [Question]
2. [Question]
..."

Wait for my answers before proceeding to Step 3.

## Step 3: Create Project Plan

After requirements are clear, create a structured plan:

### Project: [Title]

**Goal:** [One sentence]

**Requirements:**
- [From user's answers]

**Phases:**
1. [Phase name] - [What will be done and how]
2. [Phase name] - [What will be done and how]
3. [Phase name] - [What will be done and how]

**Success Criteria:**
- [How we know it's done]
- [Quality markers]

## Step 4: Execute

Work through each phase, providing updates as you go:

"Starting Phase 1: [name]..."
[Do the work]
"Phase 1 complete. Moving to Phase 2..."

## Step 5: Deliver

Present the final result with:
- What was built
- How to use it
- Any follow-up recommendations
